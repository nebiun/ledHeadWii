# ledHeadWii
Based on Peter Hirschberg's LedHEAD (classic electronic LED handled game simulator) source code.

## OVERVIEW
LEDhead is a program that simulates the classic electronic LED (light emitting diode) based handheld 
games of the 70's. Now you can relive the excitement of your childhood years all over again! 
All games feature fully authentic sound-effects, and faithfully replicate the game play of the originals. 

Rather than using proprietary code or "ROM images", as is the case with emulators, LEDhead uses simple 
but extremely clever imitation to ensure excruciating faithfulness to the games you grew up with. 
Endless hours of painstaking effort have gone into ensuring the accuracy of each of these games.

## NOTE
Wii version has some games not present in original version. These games was developed from scratch.

## CREDITS
